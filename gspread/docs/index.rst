gspread â€” Google Spreadsheets Python library
============================================

`gspread <https://github.com/burnash/gspread>`_ is a simple library
for interacting with `Google Spreadsheets`_.

Features
--------

* Open a spreadsheet by its *title*, *url* or *key*.
* Select cells by labels, e.g. 'A1'.
* Extract range, entire row or column values.
* Independent of Google Data Python client library.
* Python 3 support.


Example
-------

This code will connect to Google Data API
and fetch a cell's value from a spreadsheet::

    import gspread

    # Login with your Google account
    gc = gspread.login('account@gmail.com','password')

    # Spreadsheets can be opened by their title in Google Docs
    spreadsheet = gc.open("where's all the money gone 2011")

    # Get a first worksheet
    worksheet = spreadsheet.sheet1

    # Get a cell value
    val = worksheet.acell('B1').value

    # Or
    val = worksheet.cell(1, 2).value

The cell's value can be easily updated::

    worksheet.update_acell('B1', 'Bingo!')

    # Or
    worksheet.update_cell(1, 2, 'Bingo!')

To fetch a cell range, specify it by common notation::

    cell_list = worksheet.range('A1:A7')

After some processing, this range can be updated in batch::

    for cell in cell_list:
        cell.value = 'O_o'

    worksheet.update_cells(cell_list)
