This project is my way of helping myself find a book to read without having to do a lot of back-and-forth with the San Francisco Public Library website. 

It is written in Python with a Django framework.

Standalone CLI
---------------
You can run the core lookup logic without Django via the root-level script:

	python3 bookfairy_cli.py --list-locations

See `standalone/README.md` for full usage, Google Sheets auth, and examples.
